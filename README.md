# Snake, Water, Gun Game
A Python implementation of the classic "Snake, Water, Gun" game (similar to "Rock, Paper, Scissors"). In this game, you can choose Snake (s), Water (w), or Gun (g), and the computer randomly picks one as well. The winner is decided based on simple rules, and the game can end in a draw, a win, or a loss.

# Game Rules
Snake (s) drinks Water (w), so Snake wins.
Water (w) douses Gun (g), so Water wins.
Gun (g) kills Snake (s), so Gun wins.
If both players choose the same, it's a draw.
